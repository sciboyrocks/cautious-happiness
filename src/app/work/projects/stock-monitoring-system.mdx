## Overview

This project is a real-time stock monitoring and notification system designed specifically for Indian stocks. It fetches live stock data, provides real-time updates, and sends notifications for stock price changes and end-of-day summaries. The application also retrieves the latest news about the tracked companies, keeping you updated with their recent developments.

## Features

- **Live Stock Updates**: Fetches and displays live stock details like price, volume, market cap, P/E ratio, and sector.
- **End-of-Day Summaries**: Provides a final summary of stock performance after the market closes.
- **Push Notifications**: Sends updates via Pushbullet for stock changes and end-of-day details.
- **Company News**: Fetches the latest news articles related to the tracked companies.
- **Interactive File Editing**: Lets users dynamically manage the list of tracked stocks.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language for the backend logic.
- **APIs**: Integration with stock market APIs for real-time data.
- **Pushbullet API**: For sending notifications to various devices.
- **Web Scraping**: For retrieving company news and additional market information.
- **File I/O**: For managing stock tracking configurations.

## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenge was ensuring reliable real-time data fetching without hitting API rate limits. Implementing efficient caching mechanisms and optimizing the data refresh intervals was crucial. Additionally, parsing and filtering relevant news content required developing robust text processing algorithms to avoid irrelevant information.

## Outcome

The Stock Monitor and Notification System has become an essential tool for tracking the Indian stock market, providing timely updates and reducing the need to constantly check stock prices manually. The push notification system ensures that users never miss important price movements, while the end-of-day summaries offer valuable insights for making informed investment decisions.

This project demonstrates the ability to build real-time monitoring systems with effective notification mechanisms, showcasing skills in API integration, automated data processing, and user-friendly information delivery.
