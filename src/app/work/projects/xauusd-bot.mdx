## Overview

A high-frequency trading bot designed to execute and test strategies on real-time tick data, with an integrated backtesting engine to simulate market behavior using historical tick-level data.

## Key Features

- **Live Tick Data Integration**: Real-time market data ingestion with millisecond precision to enable lightning-fast trading decisions.
- **Strategy Module**: Plug-and-play strategy support with customizable logic for scalping, momentum, or arbitrage-based models.
- **Backtesting Engine**: Historical tick data simulation environment that mimics real-world execution delays, slippage, and order fills.
- **Risk Management**: Integrated stop-loss, take-profit, and position-sizing features to protect capital across volatile markets.
- **Performance Dashboard**: Real-time visualization of strategy metrics, equity curve, win rate, and drawdowns.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For core logic, strategy scripting, and backtesting.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For tick data manipulation and statistical calculations.
- **Websockets**: To stream real-time tick data from market APIs.
- **Plotly / Dash**: For interactive performance dashboards.
- **Docker**: To containerize and deploy in isolated environments.

## Challenges and Learnings

Key challenges included handling the sheer volume of tick data without performance degradation and simulating real-world latency in a backtesting environment. Building a scalable, modular strategy engine required thoughtful abstraction. Optimizing I/O and memory usage was critical when backtesting large tick datasets.

## Outcome

The trading bot is now capable of both live trading and historical simulation. It provides a robust playground for testing high-frequency strategies and refining real-world deployment logic. This project is a stepping stone toward creating an institutional-grade algo trading framework.
