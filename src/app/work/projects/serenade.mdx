## Overview

**Serenade** is a relationship-focused web app designed to help couples stay emotionally in sync and build stronger connections. Originally created as a personal solution to communication issues in a long-distance relationship, it has evolved into a deeply customizable and emotionally intelligent platform. It includes features such as mood tracking, AI-powered suggestions, and a shared calendar, all tailored to nurture love in a digital age.

## Features

- **Mood Tracker & Sync**: Partners can log their moods daily, and the system syncs them to identify emotional trends, friction points, and sweet spots.
- **History & Trends**: Visual graphs and logs help couples reflect on emotional highs and lows over time.
- **Shared Calendar**: A centralized calendar to manage dates, anniversaries, events, and surprises together.
- **AI-Based Gift Recommendations**: Intelligent suggestions based on mood history, past events, and personalized interests.
- **Messaging & Video Calls**: Built-in real-time communication tools to stay close anytime.
- **Streak System**: Gamified connection streaks to encourage daily check-ins and quality time.
- **Feelings Tab**: A freeform space to express thoughts or emotional states not covered by mood tags.
- **Period Tracker**: Helps partners understand and support each other better during cycles.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: Framework for front-end development.
- **Node.js + Express**: Backend server logic.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for user data and history.
- **Socket.io / WebRTC**: Real-time messaging and video communication.
- **Chart.js / D3.js**: Mood and emotional trend visualization.
- **OpenAI API** (planned): For AI-based gift and conversation suggestions.

## Challenges and Learnings

The biggest challenge was translating emotional dynamics into structured data without losing the human touch. Ensuring privacy while syncing sensitive mood and cycle information was crucial. Designing a UI that felt emotionally warm, non-intrusive, and habit-forming required multiple iterations. I also gained deeper insight into how meaningful UX design can impact emotional well-being.

## Outcome

Serenade is still evolving, but it's already helped create better conversations and deeper understanding in real relationships. It demonstrates how technology can go beyond utilityâ€”into empathy, connection, and emotional intelligence. The project is a unique blend of technical skill, personal motivation, and emotional design, and will continue to be refined with real user insights.
